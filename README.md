# MicroCSS

_Expanding upon the [ideals](https://picocss.com/#:~:text=graceful%C2%A0and%C2%A0simple,-!) of [picoCSS](https://picocss.com), with icons and helper variables_

### Adds:

* [open-props](https://open-props.style) for quick variables
* [open-color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) for nice colors and custom themes
* [micro](_micro.scss) my own personal overrides to pico and open-props, with sane defaults and batteries included
  * shadows from Material Design Language
    * inset shadows
    * outset shadows
    * proper css transitions between inset and outset
  * [nerdfont icons](https://nerdfonts.com) with easy classes within `.icon i` elements - search the [cheatsheet](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet)!
  * simple-to-use breakpoints mixin by [@kittyGiraudel](https://twitter.com/KittyGiraudel) (SCSS only). see [usage here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/sass/mixin-manage-breakpoints/)
  * inverse text color finder, from [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io/documentation/) (SCSS only). ([source](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/sass/utilities/functions.sass))
